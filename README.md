Welcome Everyone! And thank you for coming!
<p>I discovered my interest in the IT field back in 2014 when my laptop was not working properly. After analyzing and investigating, I was able to learn more about computers. After 2 years, I saved up and built my own computer. This enjoyable learning experience taught me the hardware components of a computer and how each part works. My eagerness to learn more has sent me online to learn how to code, as well as to Wake Tech for a cyber security program.</p>
<p>What you are currently looking at is a page I am creating with help and along side a course with <a href="https://alison.com/topic/learn/24111/learn-basic-html">Alison</a>. I do intend to keep this page to see my progress within the future. However this page may be edited several times. Assuming that the link I just provided you worked (I'm sorry. It only works for me becasue I am currently taking the course), You will see there is a video to what seems like will show me how to upload this page to the web server. If you are reading this without having to click on a file, that means I have succeeded. My dearest apologies. I am only rambling because, the vide will be showing me something that has something to do with scrolling. To do this, I will insert a poem I created in high that got my creative writing teachers attention. The name of the poem is <i>Mistakes</i> If you don't wish to read it, I'll be hurt, but you can click <a href="#food">here</a> for food.</p>

<p>To Mother:<br>
You were not prepared for what lied ahead of you.<br>
You got excited and rushed in<br> 
Like a swimmer diving for the first time<br>
And I understand we all make mistakes<br>
But you should know<br>
That we learn from them<br>
Because you didn't learn from them<br>
Or from your hardships in your childhood<br>
I am where I am today.<br>

<p>To Sister:<br>
As Dr. King to the world<br>
You are to me<br>
From your 14 years with Mother<br> 
You learned from them<br>
And up until it was time for me to be trained<br>
You studied your mistakes and prepared to tell me them, what to learn from them, and what to do with them<br> 
Unfortunately, I did not learn it all immediately<br> 
Slowly but surely I did learn.<br>

<p>I was always wondering<br>
Why you lived in greatness<br>
Now I know and know I don't blame you<br></p>
